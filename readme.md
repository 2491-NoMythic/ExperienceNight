# Experience The Team Night

This is programming code for the Experience the team night. The point of this night is to get students interested in our larger team and the programming team in particular. The plan is to start with the experience_one_light.py program. This program will show lighting up one single light (neopixel).

These programs are for the Adafruit Circuit Playground devices. You will need the lib/adafruit_circuitplayground library.

Keep in mind you do not have the time to "teach" these concepts. They will learn this in the python course later. Feel free to put lines of code on the board/overhead/tv/etc, or let them copy and paste code.

This is the starter program. From here we will ask for small changes to build on the program.

1. A program that shows one light
2. Explain RGB, have them change to a different color
3. Explain the pixel array and have them set 2 lights
4. Light up all 10 (with 10 separate lines)
5. Put a range (for loop) statement on the board and have them insert it into the code to light up all 10 with just the loop
6. Show the time import/command and how it can be used to delay. Note how to turn off a light and make it blink
7. Blink all the lights
8. Use 3 loops (range) to change lights from red/green/blue
9. Make some sort of loop that can create colors with math
